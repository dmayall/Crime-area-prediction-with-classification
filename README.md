# Crime-area-prediction-with-classification
A model that uses 3 types of trees to predict a place a crime may have occurred based on the predictors given (The crime, Weapon type, and season)

This was a project for a class that I completed all of the code for to produce the best calssification model I could with the predictors me and my group chose for this project. The entire file includes the data pulling, preprocssing, EDA, and then modeling and optimization of the models. My random forest perfomred the best with the main predictor usage to show which of our predictors were actually useful to the model. This was my first time with classifciation and learned alot through this project that I can apply to ensure a better result on my next project with classification.
